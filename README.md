Binge eating disorder (BED) constitutes a significant global public health concern that affects individuals of all age groups. It manifests when people consume excessive amounts of food rapidly and often experience a sense of being unable to control their eating during these episodes. This disorder can result in severe physical health complications such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. Equally distressing are the emotional challenges, as individuals grappling with BED frequently contend with feelings of guilt, shame, and anxiety following binge-eating episodes. Furthermore, societal pressures to conform to unrealistic body standards can exacerbate this issue.
The "Care Health" chatbot emerges as an innovative solution to address the multifaceted challenges associated with BED. Harnessing advanced technologies like natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), the chatbot offers tailored assistance to individuals grappling with BED. In this context, we explore the comprehensive support it delivers, including the crucial link to online consultations with Practo doctors. The chatbot initiates personalized conversations with users, aiming to help them better manage their eating habits and gain insight into their emotional triggers. By continuously analyzing user responses and behaviors, "Care Health" identifies distinctive patterns and triggers contributing to episodes of binge eating.
